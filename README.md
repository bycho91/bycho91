- I'm learning more about the React framework as I build projects. I enjoy creating websites that not only look good, but also perform well.

# ðŸŒ± What I'd like to learn in the future:
- Typescript.
- More in depth on testing tools such as Cypress and Playwright to write Test Driven code.
- Better understanding of writing clean and optimized code.
- VueJS
