## ðŸ˜„ What's your deal?
I graduated with a BS in Accounting and worked as an accountant for a little over a year. I had a hard time envisioning myself crunching numbers into an excel spread sheet for the rest of my life, so I decided to go back and get an MBA. Why did I do it? Mostly because I wanted some more time to explore what other options were out there. Although I loved the people I met there, the program itself wasn't really suited for me. It wasn't until my last semester in graduate school that I decided to take a course in Intro to Object Oriented Programming with Python. I absolutely fell in love with it. You see, before this encounter with python code, I had always had this idea in my head that only math geniuses and child prodigies with 130+ IQs could be programmers. I was wrong. And I am glad that I was wrong. Now I'm working as a QA Test Engineer, but my heart and mind lies with web development. It is truly the one thing outside of music and sports that I have ever felt passion towards. Now I am on a journey of learning the relevant technologies and skills to become the best developer that I can be.

## ðŸ”­ What I'm currently learning:
I'm learning more about the React framework as I build more and more personal projects.

## ðŸŒ± What I'd like to learn in the future:
- Using typescript with React.
- More in depth on testing tools such as Cypress and Playwright to write Test Driven code.
- Better understanding of writing clean and optimized code.
- VueJS and Svelte [once I've somewhat "mastered" React]
