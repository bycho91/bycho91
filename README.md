## ðŸ˜„ What's your deal?
I enjoy doing this in my free time - for free. But I can definitely enjoy it more if it was my full-time job :)

## ðŸ”­ What I'm currently working on:
I'm currently working on a Full-stack budget app called 'Budgety' with a wonderful cohort group from an organization called FCC Dallas. The tech stack we are using for this project is React with Typescript, React Hook Forms, Styled Components, NestJS with Typescript and Mongo as the database. I've been working mainly on the frontend side of the project, but I am starting to grow more comfortable with looking at backend code in order to better integrate the two sides together.

I am also in the process of going through the DSA Section of the FCC curriculum to better myself in my weakest area.

## ðŸŒ± What I'd like to learn in the future:
- More optimized pattnerns for complex state management
- More in depth on testing tools such as Cypress and Playwright to write Test Driven code.
- VueJS and Svelte [once I've somewhat "mastered" React]
