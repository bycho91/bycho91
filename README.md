## ðŸ˜„ What's your deal?
I currently work as a QA Engineer, but my passion is in web development. I enjoy doing this in my free time - for free. But I can definitely enjoy it more if it was my full-time job :)

## ðŸ”­ What I'm currently working on:
Learning how to build a full-stack TODO App using PERN stack. While MongoDB seems cool, I'd love to learn the advantages of a relational db.

I'm also in the process of creating a Full-stack budgeting app called 'Budgety' with a wonderful cohort group from an organization called FCC Dallas. The tech stack we are using for this project is React with Typescript, React Hook Forms, Styled Components, NestJS with Typescript and Mongo as the database. I've been working mainly on the frontend side of the project, but I am starting to grow more comfortable with looking at backend code in order to better integrate the two sides together. Come check out the live version from my portfolio!

## ðŸŒ± What I'd like to learn in the future:
- How to manage global state more efficiently (interested in React Query + Zustand combo)
- More in depth on testing tools such as Cypress
- VueJS and Svelte [once I've somewhat "mastered" React]
